# QuizzEpfc
A simple php "quizz" application I made for our students group (Epfc Brussels Web-developer).
This application allows users to create, read, update, delete "quizz".
A quizz is composed of one or multiple questions.
A question is composed of 4 multiple choices (4 elements of a "html select list" ).
Users must be logged to administrate their quizz.
A non-logged user may only read or answer to a quizz.
